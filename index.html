    <p> Q2: user will not be able to
        add more characters after a certain limit has been reached (deleting 
       characters is still possible). He asked Saksham to disable the button 
       when the text area is empty and enable it when something is typed.
       
       As an extension of this, you can also cover the edge case that the 
       button should remain disabled if there are only spaces in the text area.

       <input type="text" class="input" maxlength="6" >
